One petal
You were so young
And so was I.
We locked arms
Exchanging a love shot
Sealing our fates.
Sleepless nights
He loves me.
Two petals
Our fates ever so twisted
For it was not arms that were locked
But the spiral of confidence and egos
That brought us both down.
In a capitalistic business
Cloaked as academic institution,
You became a pawn,
I, a hero.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://quanganhtranngo.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 18:12:11 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://quanganhtranngo.github.io/about/</guid><description>Introduction I am a second-year graduate student in Social Psychology at Indiana University Bloomington from Vietnam, advised by Dr. Amanda Diekman.

The breezes of fall swept my attention away at every minute, but Josh kept my attention back on the ground. I was a magnet and so was he. Everyone was circling around him, so I chose to avoid him. In the stuffed cubical room, we were polar opposites.</description></item><item><title>On Teaching and Gardening</title><link>https://quanganhtranngo.github.io/blogs/onteachingandgardening/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 18:12:11 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://quanganhtranngo.github.io/blogs/onteachingandgardening/</guid><description>[Drawing by me, inspired by Youtuber @EveryTuesday]
