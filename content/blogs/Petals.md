One petal
You were so young
And so was I.
We locked arms
Exchanging a love shot
Sealing our fates.
Sleepless nights 
He loves me.

Two petals
Our fates ever so twisted
For it was not arms that were locked
But the spiral of confidence and egos
That brought us both down.
In a capitalistic business
Cloaked as academic institution,
You became a pawn,
I, a hero.
A promise of protection
Broken.
He loves me not.

Three petals
How to feel when I am the problem
How to feel when my presence brings
So haunting and daunting
A legacy
How to feel when to love
Is to let you go.
What is fear,
If not love turned inside out.
What is gratitude,
If guilt doesn’t lurk in the shadows.
The flower wilts.

Four petals
I swipe right since everything went left
I swipe left since nothing was right
Endless motions of meaninglessness
Empty
When the petals fall,
All that’s left is the gravity of the stem
Holding it all together
But nothing left to hold.
I love you still,
But the flower is dead.
