# Introduction
I am a graduate student studying Social Psychology at Indiana University Bloomington from Vietnam, advised by Dr. Amanda Diekman. I am particularly interested in in how sociostructural perspectives can inform the psychological study of stereotyping and person perception.

# Hobby
I love reading, dancing, and playing League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, and Maplestory in my free time.
