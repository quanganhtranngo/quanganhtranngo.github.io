# Introduction
I am a second-year graduate student in Social Psychology at Indiana University Bloomington from Vietnam, advised by Dr. Amanda Diekman. I am particularly interested in stereotyping, bias, prejudice, intersectionality, and interminority coalition.

# Hobby
I love reading, dancing, creative writing, and playing League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics in my free time.
