# Introduction
I am a first-year graduate student in Social Psychology at Indiana University Bloomington from Vietnam, advised by Dr. Amanda Diekman. I am particularly interested in the psychology of the -isms, bias, prejudice, and interminority coalition. My prior work has focused on the intersectionality of race and gender in social cognition.

# Hobby
I love reading, dancing, and playing League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics in my free time.
