## R With Alex

With the help and feedback of a lot of friends and colleagues, I have written tutorials on how to use R for data analysis, for beginners with zero experience with any coding languages. I hope this serves as a good resource for you.

You can find the blog here: https://rwithalex.vercel.app/

Have fun learning and feel free to share it with anyone who you think would benefit from it. These tutorials are definitely works in progress. So, if you have any suggestions to better the tutorials or new tutorials you want to see, feel free to reach out to me.
