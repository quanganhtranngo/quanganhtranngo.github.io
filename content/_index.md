# Hi, my name is Quang-Anh Ngo Tran (Alex Tran)!

I am a second-year graduate student in the Social Psychology department at Indiana University Bloomington from Vietnam, advised by Dr. Amanda Diekman. I am particularly interested in stereotyping, bias, prejudice, intersectionality, and interminority coalition. 

My blog is a mix of my own creative pieces, poetry, and drawings/doodles.
